# Predicting Loan Defaults: Random-Forest

The original csv can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/kmldas/loan-default-prediction

This project implements a random forest classification algorithm from scratch (no machine learning libraries used) to classify whether or not a person will default on their loan. There are 3 features/classifiers used: Employment (discrete and binary), Bank Balance (continuous), and Annual Salary (continuous). The classification, of course, is binary.

<b>This repository contains two python notebooks and the original csv dataset. The first python notebook ("intro.ipynb") contains an overview of how the random forest works. The second python notebook ("random_forest.ipynb") contains the implementation and testing of the random forest.</b>

### The random forest is built from scratch and is able to classify with an accuracy of approximately 97%.
